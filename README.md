ETL Process for Data Files
Welcome to the ETL script for data files! This Python script is designed to perform the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process on various data file formats, including CSV, JSON, and XML. The script utilizes the pandas library for data manipulation and xml.etree.ElementTree for XML parsing.

Introduction
In the world of data processing, ETL plays a crucial role in managing and transforming data from diverse sources into a usable and consistent format. This script exemplifies a simple ETL process, demonstrating how to extract data from different file formats, apply transformations, and finally load the processed data into a new CSV file.

How to Use
Clone the Repository:
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:



git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

cd your-repository

Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:


pip install pandas

Run the Script:

Execute the ETL script with the following command:

python etl_script.py
Review Output:
The transformed data will be saved in a file named transformed_data.csv. Check the log_file.txt for a detailed log of the ETL process.

Script Overview
etl_script.py:

Main script implementing the ETL process.
log_file.txt:

Log file capturing the progress and timestamps during the ETL process.
transformed_data.csv:

Output CSV file containing the transformed data.
Notes
The script assumes that the data files (CSV, JSON, and XML) are located in the same directory as the script. Adjust file paths accordingly if your files are in a different location.

Ensure the required Python dependencies are installed before running the script.
